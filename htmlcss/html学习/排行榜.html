      "answer. Imagine that someone really is asking " +
      "the question. The more deeply you force your " +
      "brain to think, the better chance you have of " +
      "learning and remembering",
      "We put them in, but if we did them for you, " +
      "that would be like having someone else do " +
      "your workouts for you. And don’t just look at " +
      "the exercises. Use a pencil. There’s plenty of " +
      "evidence that physical activity while learning " +
      "can increase the learning.",
      "That means all of them. They’re not optional " +
      "sidebars—they’re part of the core content! " +
      "Don’t skip them",
      "Part of the learning (especially the transfer to " +
      "long-term memory) happens after you put the " +
      "book down. Your brain needs time on its own, to " +
      "do more processing. If you put in something new " +
      "during that processing-time, some of what you " +
      "just learned will be lost.",
      "Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid. " +
      "Dehydration (which can happen before you ever " +
      "feel thirsty) decreases cognitive function.",
      "Speaking activates a different part of the brain. " +
      "If you’re trying to understand something, or " +
      "increase your chance of remembering it later, say " +
      "it out loud. Better still, try to explain it out loud " +
      "to someone else. You’ll learn more quickly, and " +
      "you might uncover ideas you hadn’t known were " +
      "there when you were reading about it",
      "Pay attention to whether your brain is getting " +
      "overloaded. If you find yourself starting to skim the " +
      "surface or forget what you just read, it’s time for a " +
      "break. Once you go past a certain point, you won’t " +
      "learn faster by trying to shove more in, and you " +
      "might even hurt the process",
      "Your brain needs to know that this matters. Get " +
      "involved with the stories. Make up your own " +
      "captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke is " +
      "still better than feeling nothing at all",
      "Apply this to something new you’re designing, or " +
      "rework an older project. Just do something to get some " +
      "experience beyond the exercises and activities in " +
      "this book. All you need is a pencil and a problem " +
      "to solve… a problem that might benefit from using " +
      "JavaScript.",
      "You’ve got to create a lot of new brain connections " +
      "to learn to program. Sleep often; it helps"
